## Technology Stack

Our app is built on the robust MERN (MongoDB, Express, React Native, Node.js) stack:

- _MongoDB_: Our data is hosted on MongoDB Atlas, ensuring seamless data management, reliability, and scalability.
- _Express_: The backend's powerful API is built using Express and is hosted on [onrender.com](https://backend-messenger.onrender.com) for efficient communication between the frontend and the database.
- _React Native_: The frontend is developed using React Native, enabling a fluid and responsive user interface across both iOS and Android platforms.
- _Node.js_: The backend server is powered by Node.js, facilitating dynamic and efficient server-side operations.
